# DS18B20_USART_DMA_STM32
DS18B20 temperature sensor. One wire, USART-compatible, DMA, STM32, stm32duino.
This is an example of work with a temperature sensor with one-wire interface (USART+DMA+TIMER).
The data gained from sensor is processed (raw data) to temperature.
The example created for stm32f103c8t6 (Arduino).
